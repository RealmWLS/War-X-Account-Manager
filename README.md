## 📌 Project Description

War X Account Manager is a terminal utility that interacts with the Discord API to automate several account management actions. It uses a token-based login system and provides a clean CLI interface with gradient text styling.

The tool collects a user's guilds (servers), friends, and direct message channels, allowing the user to manage them quickly using different menu options.

It is built using Python and uses libraries like **requests**, **colorama**, and **pystyle** to handle API requests and provide a visually styled command-line interface.
